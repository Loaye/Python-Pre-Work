# Python 401 Pre-Work
=======================

## Unit 3: PygLatin - Part 10
-------------------------------
### This is pretty straight forward. We just are manipulating a string. We select the portions that we want, slice the first letter off of a given word, then created a new variable that is set to "ay" and concatanate them all together. Finally we set the concatanation to a var of new_word and return that value.

## Unit 4: Taking a Vacation - part 7
---------------------------------------
### Just adding additional parameters and setting them to return by concatanating them in a return statement.

## Unit 5: A Day at the Supermarket - part 12
-----------------------------------------------
### We are using the indexes and key pairs of the dictionaries to compare values. Based on our conditions we manipulate values to add to the total price, with checking to see if the item is in stock, and if it is we subtract 1 of the total in stock.

## Unit 6: Student Becomes the Teacher - part 9
-------------------------------------------------
### The chaining ideas that I used with JS dont seem to be working the same. It seems like I have to take an extra step to and add extra declaritives. 

## Unit 7: Battleship! - part 18
----------------------------------
### Going from JS to this was interesting to think of how I would of done it in JS. I honestly think Python made it easier. Going from taking a list, multiplying it by an integer to set a grid. Join the 0's with a join method and an empty string to get rid of the brackets of a list on the print, then importing a random generator to set our hidden ships. The rest is just for loops and comparisons with nested if/else statements. I really liked this!
